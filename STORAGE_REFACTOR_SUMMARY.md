# Storage-Based Refactor Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major refactor of the posts and assets tabs to move from a database-driven approach to a storage-based approach.

## Key Changes

### 1. Storage Service (`/lib/services/storage-service.ts`)
- Created a comprehensive service for managing assets in Supabase storage
- Singleton pattern for consistent access across the app
- Key features:
  - List assets from different folders (ready/used/archived)
  - Move assets between folders
  - Delete assets
  - Search assets
  - Get asset statistics
  - Initialize folder structure

### 2. Asset Types
- **Video**: Single video files
- **Carousel**: Folders containing multiple images
- **Image**: Single image files

### 3. Folder Structure
```
generated-carousels/
├── assets/
│   ├── ready/      # Assets ready to be posted
│   ├── used/       # Assets that have been posted
│   └── archived/   # Archived assets
```

### 4. New Components

#### Asset Selector Modal (`/components/asset-selector-modal.tsx`)
- Beautiful modal for selecting assets from storage
- Features:
  - Folder navigation (ready/used/archived)
  - Search functionality
  - Multi-select support
  - Asset type filtering
  - Preview capabilities

#### Assets Page (`/app/assets/`)
- Complete asset management interface
- Features:
  - View assets by folder
  - Upload new assets
  - Move assets between folders
  - Delete assets
  - Preview assets
  - Grid and list views
  - Bulk operations

#### Posts Page (`/app/posts/`)
- Refactored to use storage-based approach
- Features:
  - Display cloud phones in a grid
  - Click "Assign Asset" to open asset selector
  - Create assignments pairing assets with phones
  - Batch post creation
  - Automatic asset movement to "used" folder after posting

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No complex database relationships to manage
2. **Flexibility**: Any asset can be paired with any phone
3. **Visibility**: Clear folder structure shows asset status
4. **Scalability**: Storage-based approach scales better
5. **User Experience**: More intuitive asset management

## Migration Notes

### Database Tables (To Be Removed)
- `image_generation_jobs`
- `carousel_variants`
- `variant_slides`
- `carousel_variant_assignments`

### API Endpoints to Update
- `/api/geelark/post-carousel` - Already works with image URLs
- `/api/geelark/post-video` - Already works with video URLs

## Usage Flow

1. **Upload/Generate Assets**: Assets are placed in the `ready` folder
2. **Assign to Phones**: Use the posts page to pair assets with cloud phones
3. **Create Posts**: Batch create posts, assets automatically move to `used`
4. **Archive**: Manually move old assets to `archived` folder

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metadata Storage**: Store additional metadata (captions, hashtags) with assets
2. **Duplicate Detection**: Prevent uploading duplicate assets
3. **Batch Upload**: Support uploading multiple assets at once
4. **Asset Preview**: Enhanced preview with video playback
5. **Analytics**: Track which assets perform best

## Technical Details

### Storage Asset Interface
```typescript
interface StorageAsset {
  id: string
  name: string
  path: string
  url: string
  thumbnailUrl?: string
  type: 'video' | 'carousel' | 'image' | 'folder'
  size: number
  created_at: string
  updated_at: string
  metadata: any
  status: 'ready' | 'used' | 'archived'
  children?: StorageAsset[]  // For carousels
}
```

### Key Methods
- `listAssets(folder)`: List all assets in a folder
- `moveAsset(asset, targetFolder)`: Move asset between folders
- `deleteAsset(asset)`: Delete asset and its children
- `searchAssets(query, folder)`: Search assets by name
- `getAssetStats()`: Get statistics for all folders
