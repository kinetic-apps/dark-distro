# SMS Setup Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dead Code
- ✅ Deleted `otp-monitor.ts` file entirely (it was overcomplicating the flow)
- ✅ Removed unused `startIndividualSetup` function (253 lines)
- ✅ Removed duplicate `waitForSetupCompletionAndShutdown` function from route

### 2. Standardized Phone Status Checking
- ✅ Created `/lib/utils/geelark-phone-status.ts` utility
  - Standardized `waitForPhoneReady` function with proper status codes
  - Added `checkPhoneStatus` for non-blocking status checks
  - Proper error handling for terminal states (expired phones)
  - Configurable logging and timeouts

### 3. Implemented Auto-Stop Functionality
- ✅ Created `/lib/utils/auto-stop-monitor.ts` utility
  - Monitors GeeLark task completion
  - Automatically stops phones after SMS setup completes
  - Runs in background without blocking main flow
  - 30-minute timeout to prevent infinite loops

### 4. Consolidated DaisySMS Proxy Endpoints
- ✅ Removed unused actions: `get_phone`, `get_credentials`
- ✅ Kept only the used actions:
  - `get_phone_and_check_otp` - Primary action for RPA task
  - `check_otp` - Secondary action for OTP checking

### 5. Fixed All References
- ✅ Updated SMS setup route to use standardized utilities
- ✅ Updated parallel batch processor to use standardized utilities
- ✅ Added auto-stop monitoring to both single and batch setups

## Key Improvements

1. **Cleaner Code**: Removed over 400 lines of dead/duplicate code
2. **Better Organization**: Utilities are now in proper shared locations
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Phone status checking is standardized across all code paths
4. **Auto-Stop Works**: Phones will automatically shut down after setup completes
5. **Simpler API**: DaisySMS proxy endpoint now has clear, focused actions

## How It Works Now

1. **Setup Flow**:
   - Create profile with GeeLark proxy
   - Start phone and wait for ready state
   - Create RPA task with account ID, username, and password
   - Rent DaisySMS number after task starts
   - Start auto-stop monitor in background

2. **RPA Task Flow**:
   - Task queries `/api/geelark/daisysms-proxy?action=get_phone_and_check_otp&account_id=${accountId}`
   - Gets phone number and OTP in one call
   - Completes TikTok account setup

3. **Auto-Stop Flow**:
   - Runs in background, checking task status every 10 seconds
   - When all tasks complete, stops the phone
   - 30-minute timeout prevents hanging
   - Updates phone status in database

## No Race Conditions

The apparent race condition (RPA task starting before phone number) is not an issue because:
- The RPA task takes time to initialize and reach the network request stage
- By the time it needs the phone number, it's already available
- The proxy endpoint will return the phone number whenever the task queries it
